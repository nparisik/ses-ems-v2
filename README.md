# Employee Management System
 Employee Management System for SES Union Office. 

## About
Technologies used: Spring Boot, Thymeleaf, MySql, Postman


This is a simple Spring Boot web app that performs CRUD operations on employee records, stored in a MySql database.
I designed this application to achieve my goal of understanding Spring Boot and how much easier it makes creating Java Enterprise web apps.


## App in Use
